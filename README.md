## 🎯 Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### **Combat System**
- **Damage Calculation**: Base damage ± random variance for realism
- **Morale System**: Soldiers retreat when morale drops below threshold  
- **Range Mechanics**: Different weapons have different effective ranges
- **Attack Cooldowns**: Balanced timing prevents spam attacks

### **AI Behavior**
- **Target Selection**: Closest enemy prioritization
- **Movement AI**: Pathfinding around obstacles and other soldiers
- **State Machine**: Idle → Moving → Attacking → Retreating → Celebrating
- **Group Dynamics**: Soldiers influence each other's morale

### **Physics Engine**
- **Collision Detection**: Circular collision bounds for all entities
- **Boundary Checking**: Soldiers stay within battlefield limits  
- **Smooth Movement**: Interpolated animations for fluid gameplay
- **Performance Optimization**: Spatial partitioning for large armies
